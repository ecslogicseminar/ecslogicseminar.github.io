# Abstract
A promising approach for safe AI is given by blending symbolic reasoning with Neural Networks (NNs). Often this involves using logics with differentiable real-valued interpretations for property-driven training. We refer to such logics as Differentiable Logics (DLs). In particular, they are useful for giving programming language support to property-driven learning. However, it is difficult to develop a well-behaved first-order DL. Well understood logics, such as substructural fuzzy logics, often possess non-continuous operators that hinder performance. On the other hand, logics proposed by the ML community often lack a calculus or formal semantics. In this talk, I introduce our ongoing work on developing a novel first-order DL designed for property-driven learning, leveraging Rocq.
