# Abstract
A promising approach for safe AI is given by blending symbolic reasoning with Neural Networks. Often this involves using logics with differentiable real-valued interpretations for property-driven training. We refer to such logics as Differentiable Logics (DLs).  The growing interest in DLs has motivated their use to give programming language support for safe machine learning. In particular, DLs are useful for compiling specifications to the back-ends of neural network verifiers.  However, it is difficult to develop a well-behaved first-order DL. Well understood logics, such as substructural fuzzy logics, often possess non-continuous operators that hinder performance. On the other hand, logics proposed by the machine learning community often lack a calculus or formal semantics. In this talk, I introduce our ongoing work on developing a novel first-order DL designed for property-driven learning, leveraging Rocq.
