# Abstract
The Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) is a key operation within Digital Signal
Processing and other fields, but when implemented trivially it is slow. Fast Fourier
Transforms (FFTs) allow for the time complexity of computing the DFT to be
significantly reduced, allowing for algorithms with a reliance on the DFT to reduce
their time complexity.
Traditionally, implementations of the FFT are formed in low level languages, with
large amounts of index manipulation. These languages rarely provide frameworks
for formal verification, meaning that functionality must be confirmed manually, with
methods such as unit testing. Such methods of testing are unable to provide formal
guarantees that a implementation is correct for every possible value.
Agda is a dependently typed functional language implementing Martin-Löf type
theory. This allows for the embedding of formal proofs allowing programs in Agda to
contain formal guarantees of their correctness. For the FFT this allows the embedding
of a proof that the DFT is equal to the FFT for every possible input value.
In this project I have provided an implementation of the FFT within Agda. I have
then provided a proof of equivalence between this implementation and the DFT, thus
guaranteeing the correctness of my implementation.`
